## Version 1: Story-Based Hook

---

I just completed an AODA audit for a housing provider in Southern Ontario.

They thought they were doing everything right.

Then I showed them their tenant portal—which 40% of their residents literally couldn't access.

No keyboard navigation. Incompatible with screen readers. Forms that required a mouse to complete.

Here's what shocked them most: They were one complaint away from penalties that could reach $100,000 per day.

With 1 in 4 Ontarians living with a disability (2.6 million people), AODA compliance isn't just about avoiding fines. It's about serving your entire community.

In my latest article, I break down:

♿ The 4 most common AODA violations I see in Ontario housing
📋 A 30-day action plan to achieve compliance
💼 Why mixed income and near market rental providers face extra scrutiny
✅ Real-world case study showing the impact of proper implementation

The good news? Once we fixed their issues, they saw a 23% increase in tenant portal usage. Accessible design benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities.

## Version 2: Stat-Based Hook

---

1 in 4 Ontarians lives with a disability.

That's 2.6 million people your housing organization could be excluding if you're not AODA compliant.

And here's the part that keeps housing executives up at night: penalties for serious violations can reach $100,000 per day.

After conducting dozens of AODA audits across Ontario, I consistently see the same 4 violations:

1. ❌ Inaccessible websites (no keyboard navigation, missing alt text)
2. ❌ PDF documents that screen readers can't interpret
3. ❌ Missing or outdated accessibility policies
4. ❌ Inadequate staff training

But here's what surprised me most:

Many housing providers don't realize their tenant portals, application systems, and maintenance request platforms are completely inaccessible to a quarter of Ontarians.

In my latest article, I share:

• A real case study of a mixed income housing provider I worked with
• Their accessibility journey (and the 23% increase in portal usage they saw)
• A practical 30-day action plan you can implement today
• Why near market rental programs need to pay extra attention

The key insight? Accessibility isn't just compliance—it's good business. Accessible design makes life easier for everyone: seniors, non-native speakers, and power users alike.

As Ontario's population ages, accessibility needs will only grow. The question isn't whether you can afford to become compliant—it's whether you can afford not to.

## Version 3: Question Hook (Short & Punchy)

---

Quick question for Ontario housing providers:

Can your tenants access your website using only a keyboard?

If you're not sure—that's a problem.

WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance isn't optional under AODA. It's the law.

Yet I regularly audit housing organizations whose:
• Websites are inaccessible to screen readers
• PDFs can't be read by assistive technology
• Tenant portals require mouse use
• Staff haven't had AODA training in years

One provider I worked with had NO IDEA they were excluding hundreds of potential tenants with disabilities.

After we fixed their compliance issues, they saw a 23% increase in tenant portal usage. Accessible design benefits everyone.

With penalties reaching $100,000/day for serious violations, and 1 in 4 Ontarians living with a disability, this isn't just about risk management—it's about responsibility.

I just published a comprehensive guide covering:
✅ Common AODA violations in housing
✅ 30-day compliance action plan
✅ Real case study with results
✅ Why mixed income communities must pay extra attention

OR

"One more thing: Many housing providers ask me about the cost of AODA compliance. In my experience, proactive compliance costs 60-70% less than reactive fixes after a complaint. Prevention is cheaper than cure."
