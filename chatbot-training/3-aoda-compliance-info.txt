AODA COMPLIANCE INFORMATION

What is AODA?
AODA stands for Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. It's Ontario legislation requiring organizations to make their services, spaces, and communications accessible to people with disabilities.

Why AODA Compliance is Critical:

1. Legal Requirement
   - All Ontario organizations must comply with AODA standards
   - Penalties for non-compliance: Up to $100,000 per day for serious violations

2. Serve All Community Members
   - Approximately 1 in 4 Ontarians live with a disability
   - Accessibility ensures everyone can access your housing services

3. Better Tenant Experience
   - Accessible communications work better for everyone
   - Clear, simple processes benefit all tenants
