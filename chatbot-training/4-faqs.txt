MIXED INCOME COMMUNITIES

Q: What is a mixed income community?
A: A mixed income community is a housing development that includes residents from different income levels - typically a mix of market-rate tenants and those receiving rent subsidies or paying rent-geared-to-income. This creates economically diverse, socially integrated communities.

Q: What challenges do mixed income communities face?
A: Common challenges include balancing financial sustainability with affordability, managing different tenant types fairly, preventing stigma, and creating true social integration rather than just physical proximity.

Q: How can you help with mixed income community development?
A: We provide community planning, feasibility studies, income mix optimization, tenant selection guidance, social integration programs, and performance monitoring.

NEAR MARKET RENTALS

Q: What are near market rentals?
A: Near market rentals are housing units rented at rates below market value but above deeply subsidized rates. They bridge the gap between fully subsidized affordable housing and market-rate housing.

Q: Who qualifies for near market rentals?
A: Eligibility varies by program but typically includes moderate-income households who earn too much to qualify for deeply subsidized housing but struggle with market-rate rents. Income verification is usually required.

Q: How do you calculate near market rents?
A: We help you establish rent calculation protocols that balance affordability with sustainability, typically based on area median income percentages and local market conditions, while ensuring compliance with provincial requirements.

AODA COMPLIANCE

Q: What is AODA?
A: AODA stands for Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. It's Ontario legislation requiring organizations to make their services, spaces, and communications accessible to people with disabilities.

Q: Do I need to be AODA compliant?
A: Yes. All Ontario organizations, including housing providers, must comply with AODA standards. Non-compliance can result in penalties up to $100,000 per day for serious violations.

Q: What does AODA compliance involve?
A: It includes making your website keyboard-accessible, ensuring screen reader compatibility, providing accessible documents, training staff on accessibility, and creating accessible communication strategies.

Q: Do you offer AODA audits?
A: Yes! We offer a free 30-minute AODA compliance consultation to identify accessibility gaps. Schedule at: https://tidycal.com/aiautomations/aoda-audit

Q: How long does it take to become AODA compliant?
A: It depends on your current state. A basic website can often be made compliant in a few weeks. We'll assess your specific situation during the audit and provide a realistic timeline.

Q: What are the penalties for non-compliance?
A: Penalties can reach up to $100,000 per day for serious violations. Beyond legal risks, non-compliance prevents you from serving all community members equally.
