Who We Serve:
We serve housing providers across Ontario, including:

- Municipal housing authorities
- Near market rental providers
- Mixed income community developers

Our Mission:
At AI Advantage Solutions, we're committed to supporting housing providers across Ontario who are creating mixed income communities and delivering near market rental housing. We believe that everyone deserves access to quality, affordable housing in communities where they can thrive.

Our work centers on helping housing providers deliver exceptional value to their tenants while maintaining operational excellence and full AODA compliance.

What We Do:
We partner with housing providers to:

1. Develop Mixed Income Communities
   - Strategic planning and implementation support for creating economically diverse, socially integrated housing communities

2. Optimize Near Market Rental Programs
   - Expertise in program design, tenant selection, rent-geared-to-income calculations, and sustainable operations

3. Ensure AODA Compliance
   - Full accessibility compliance for all communications, digital platforms, and tenant services

4. Enhance Tenant Experience
   - Tools and strategies to improve tenant engagement, satisfaction, and community building

5. Streamline Operations
   - Process optimization, automation, and efficiency improvements that save time and resources

Our Approach:
- PRACTICAL: Designed for real-world implementation, not just theory
- TENANT-CENTERED: Focused on improving experiences for the people you serve
- COMPLIANT: Meeting or exceeding AODA and other regulatory requirements
- SUSTAINABLE: Built for long-term success and scalability
- VALUE-DRIVEN: Delivering measurable improvements to your operations and community outcomes

Why AODA Compliance Matters:
Accessibility isn't just about compliance – it's about ensuring every tenant, regardless of ability, can fully access your services and participate in their community. With approximately 1 in 4 Ontarians living with a disability, AODA compliance is essential to serving all members of your community.

Service Area:
Based in Hamilton, we serve housing providers across the province of Ontario. We understand the Ontario housing landscape, regulatory environment, and the communities you serve.
